Blender addon for import and export of Dawn of War models

## Key features
- **Import and Export Functionality**: Supports the Dawn of War model format(`.whm`), including meshes, textures, bones, markers and animations.
* **Object Editor support**: Allows export to Object Editor model format(`.sgm`) so you can configure the unit properties, e.g. motions and actions.
- **Automatic texture conversion**: Automatically imports `.rsh` texture data, including all additional layers, and exports all of it back.
